    "Where am I? What happened to me??"
    "All these thoughts and questions race through my mind. I'm completely panicked."
    "I stand up shakily, stumbling over to the door and trying the handle. It's locked."
    "I try the window next to the bed. Also locked."
    "I desperately search for some way to escape, but the room is completely shut off..."
    "I flop onto the bed, groaning in frustration."
    "This is the worst... I can't believe this..."
    "I need to calm down, first of all. Acting irrationally could mean death in this situation."
    "I take a few deep inhales, trying to calm my nerves. After a few tries, closing my eyes and focusing on clearing my mind, I finally begin to relax slightly."
    "The main thing is, for now at least, I'm safe. It doesn't seem like there's anything in this room that is an imminent threat."
    "As long as the kidnapper isn't here..."
    "I stand up once more, taking a look around."
    "It just looks like a normal bedroom. The decoration is plain and there isn't really much standing out. It's neat and tidy."
    "I sit back down on the bed, trying to make sense of all of this."
    "To make things worse, I can't even remember what happened to bring me here... All I remember is heading out for a New Year's Party..."
